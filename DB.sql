Akande Ogundimu was born into a well-regarded Nigerian family, heir to its prosthetic-technology company. A highly intelligent and charismatic figure, Ogundimu helped to expand his family\'s business and position it for the future while dedicating his free time to his first love: competitive martial arts. He trained in traditional African fighting styles, including Dambe and Gidigbo, as well as in wrestling and other modern combat systems, incorporating the most effective techniques into his repertoire. Ogundimu competed in tournaments all over the continent, utilizing his intuition and ability to read opponents alongside his tremendous speed and strength.	But when he lost his right arm in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis, it seemed his martial arts career was finished before he had reached his prime. His company\'s cybernetic prosthetics allowed him to recover from his injuries, even making him stronger, but these enhancements rendered him ineligible for competition. He tried to devote himself to his business with the same zeal that he had for fighting, but he found nothing that could fill the void… until he was given a new opportunity by Akinjide Adeyemi, better known to the world as the second Doomfist, the Scourge of Numbani.	Adeyemi offered Ogundimu the chance to fight with him as a mercenary. Initially wary, Ogundimu accepted, and discovered that he now had an arena in which he could unleash his enhanced capabilities. Eventually, Adeyemi brought him into the Talon organization. Talon\'s belief that humanity would be made stronger through conflict resonated with Ogundimu\'s personal experiences. Moreover, Talon\'s power struggles presented a new challenge that allowed him to use his talent in the boardroom along with his cunning as a combatant.	Adeyemi was a useful asset to Talon, but the organization saw far greater potential in Ogundimu, with his intelligence and his ability to inspire as a commander. While Adeyemi was content to profit from raids on Numbani, Ogundimu had a grander vision. This difference in aspiration would lead Ogundimu to kill his teacher and take on the mantle of Doomfist, along with the eponymous gauntlet.	As the new Doomfist, Ogundimu rose high in Talon and helped to orchestrate a conflict that the organization hoped would someday engulf the world. However, before their plan came to fruition, Ogundimu was defeated and captured by an Overwatch strike team that included Tracer, Winston, and Genji. He was imprisoned in a maximum-security facility for years, where he waited patiently for events he had incited to play out.	Finally, he sensed that the time had come for him to return. He broke out of his prison and recovered Doomfist\'s gauntlet in a one-sided battle with Numbani\'s newly unveiled OR15 defense robots.

He had little interest in the family\'s illegal businesses, and although he excelled at and enjoyed his ninja training, he spent most of his time pursuing a playboy lifestyle. Many within the clan considered the carefree Genji to be a dangerous liability, and they resented his father for coddling and protecting him. Following the clan leader\'s untimely death, Genji\'s older brother, Hanzo, demanded that Genji take a more active role in their late father\'s empire. Genji refused, enraging Hanzo. The tension between the brothers built to a violent confrontation that left Genji on the verge of dying.\r\n\r\nHanzo believed that he had killed his brother, but Genji was rescued by Overwatch and the intervention of Dr. Angela Ziegler. The global security force saw Genji as a potential asset in its ongoing operations to combat the Shimada clan. As Genji\'s injuries left him clinging to life, Overwatch offered to rebuild his body in exchange for his help. He was put through an extensive process of cyberization, which enhanced his natural speed and agility and augmented his superlative ninja skills. Transformed into a living weapon, Genji single-mindedly set about the task of dismantling his family\'s criminal empire.\r\n\r\nBut as time passed, Genji felt increasingly at war with himself. He was repulsed by the mechanical parts of his body and could not come to grips with what he had become. When his mission was complete, he abandoned Overwatch and wandered the world in search of meaning. He drifted for many years before crossing paths with the omnic monk Zenyatta. Though Genji initially rejected Zenyatta\'s wisdom, the benevolent omnic would not be deterred. In time, Zenyatta became his mentor, and under the monk\'s tutelage, Genji reconciled his dual existence as both man and machine. He learned to accept that although he had a cyborg body, his human soul was intact, and he came to see his new form as a gift and a unique strength.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time in his life, Genji is free.

McCree appreciated the flexibility afforded to the clandestine Blackwatch, unhindered by bureaucracy and red tape.

It was this expertise that attracted the attention of Overwatch.\r\n\r\nBecause her parents had been taken by war, Ziegler was opposed to the organization\'s militaristic approach to keeping global peace. Ultimately, she recognized that Overwatch offered her the opportunity to save lives on a much larger scale. As Overwatch\'s head of medical research, Angela sought to leverage her work for healing in frontline crises. The result was the Valkyrie swift-response suit, which Ziegler herself piloted on many Overwatch missions.\r\n\r\nDespite her contributions to Overwatch, she was often at odds with her superiors and the organization\'s overarching aims. When Overwatch dissolved, Ziegler dedicated herself to helping those affected by war.\r\n\r\nThough she spends most of her time caring for the broken and dispossessed in crisis areas around the world, Dr. Ziegler can be counted on to don her Valkyrie suit whenever innocents are imperiled.'),(24,'Satya Vaswani',28,'Architech','Utopaea, India','Vishkar Corporation','“The true enemy of humanity is disorder.”','Symmetra literally bends reality. By manipulating hard-light constructs, she crafts the world as she wishes it to be, in hopes of engineering a perfect society.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Omnic Crisis, the Vishkar Corporation of southern India began the laborious process of creating new, self-sustaining cities to house the nation\'s displaced population. One such city, Utopaea, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city\'s streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nAfter she was identified as one of the few capable of becoming a light-bending architech, young Satya Vaswani was plucked from extreme poverty and placed in the care of Vishkar\'s architech academy, never to return home. Isolated and lonely in her new life, Satya immersed herself in her education and training. She quickly grasped the applications of the technology and was one of the top students in her class. Satya approached hard-light manipulation differently than her peers, with their more procedural, mechanical constructions, instead weaving her constructs in the motions of the traditional dance of her homeland.\r\n\r\nThough she was one of Utopaea\'s top architechs, the Vishkar Corporation saw far greater potential in Satya\'s abilities. Giving her the moniker \"Symmetra,\" Vishkar sent her on clandestine missions around the world to uphold its corporate interests and expand its influence into other countries.\r\n\r\nSymmetra believes her actions serve the greater good in society. But there are times when she wonders whether the control and order she desires are truly best for humanity.'),(25,'Tekhartha Zenyatta',20,'Wandering Guru, Adventur','Shambali Monastery, Nepal (formerly)','The Shambali (formerly)','\"True self is without form.\"','Zenyatta is an omnic monk who wanders the world in search of spiritual enlightenment. It is said that those who cross his path are never the same again.\r\n\r\nYears ago, following the Omnic Crisis, a group of outcast omnic robots experienced what they described as a spiritual awakening. They abandoned their preprogrammed lives to establish a communal monastery deep in the Himalayas. After many years of meditation on the nature of existence, they came to the belief that they were more than artificial intelligences and that, like humans, they possessed the essence of a soul.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the spiritual equality they held with humans, the monks, led by the enigmatic robot known as Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the wounds caused by the Omnic Crisis a generation earlier and bring humans and robots back into societal harmony. Their message was embraced by millions around the world, and they became global celebrities.\r\n\r\nBut one monk, Zenyatta, disagreed with this new direction. He believed that the way to repair the problems between humans and omnics was not through dogmatic teaching but through interpersonal connection and engagement.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Zenyatta followed his own path. He chose to leave the monastery and wander the world, helping those he meets to overcome their personal struggles and find inner peace. But, when necessary, he will fight to protect the innocent, be they omnic or human.');
